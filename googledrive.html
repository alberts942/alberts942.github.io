            <p>Google Drive is a great place to store documents and slide shows and spreadsheets and mant other great reasources mugh like microsoft word did but google drive is better. </p>          
            <p>when Im using this resource in school it's great for making new documents so I can take notes on or do homework on for example, in history I have to take notes and I sometimes use google drive to store that document so I can keep it and easily keep track of it to find it easy.</p>
            <p>If I had to chose between Google Drive and a different wbesite storage system such as microsoft word I would 99.9% of the time choose google drive. The only time I would choose another is when I don't need to keep the document and all I need to do is write it out and print it or something.</p>
