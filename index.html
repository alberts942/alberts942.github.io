              <p>This is a website that shows some of the websites that I, AJ, use to do school stuff sometimes</p>
              <p>I hope you Enjoy! or not cause this website is really irrelevant to the fact that nobody would care what wbesites I actually use this is only for a class final just sayin'.</p>
              <p>I'm really weird and I like anime and i watch it all the time even at night so if you don't like anime than don't mess with me otherwise we are gonna have to duel and that would be bad for me and your reputation.</p>
              <p>if you have read this far into the first page than good for you so click on the links and you can see stuff that nobody cares about.</p>
